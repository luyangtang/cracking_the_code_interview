# Circle circleDetect

Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.

*DEFINITION*
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an
earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

*EXAMPLE*
input: `A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C` [the same `C` as earlier]
output: `C`

Nodes with identical data may not necessarily need to be the same node. Anything at the same address should be consider the same.

[mySolution](./circleDetect) defines a unique ID for each Node generated by introducing a static (global) node counter. By comparing against bit vector we can search for visited nodes.
