# VI.8

You are looking for a specific value in a binary tree, but the tree is not a binary search tree.
What is the time complexity of this?

If the tree is not a search tree (unordered) then we need to traverse the tree. So the time complexity is (similar to reasoning as VI.7) ![O(n)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O%28n%29).
