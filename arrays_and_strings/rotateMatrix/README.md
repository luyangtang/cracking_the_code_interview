# 1.7 Rotate matrix

*Rotate Matrix*: Given an image represented by an ![O(N\times N)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O%28N%5Ctimes%20N%29) matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

![a_{i,j} \rightarrow a_{j,n-1-i}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20a_%7Bj%2Cn-1-i%7D)
