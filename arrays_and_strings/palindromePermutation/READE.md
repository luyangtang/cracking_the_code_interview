# 1.4 Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

[My Solution](./palindromePermutation/mysolution.cpp) - A word is a permutation of a Palindrome word if and only if at most 1 character has an odd count. (Not taking white space into account). By referring to ASCII table, this algorithm ignores special characters and is case insensitive.
